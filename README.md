# Physionet-2023_python_example_explanation
In this repo, I aim to explore and offer detailed explanations of the process involved in the "[Physionet 2023 python-example-code](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-example-2023)". I will present step-by-step breakdowns of specific components such as helper_code, run_model, train_model, etc. to gain more insight into the coding process. 

The open-source segment of the "[I-CARE dataset](https://physionet.org/content/i-care/2.0/#files)" includes baseline clinical information, continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from 607 patients. The provided dataset is structured with a parent folder named 'training,' which contains 607 subfolders. Each subfolder is named based on a patient number, such as '0284'. The contents of each patient folder include various files with different extensions, which we will discuss during the code review. 

First of all, we will start with the [helper_code]([https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-example-2024/blob/main/helper_code.py](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-example-2023/blob/master/helper_code.py)):
# helper_code
In this segment of the Python example code, I will discusse some helper functions that will be utilized during the implementation:

**1-"find_data_folders (root_folder)" function:**
```python
def find_data_folders(root_folder):
    data_folders = list()
    for x in sorted(os.listdir(root_folder)):
        data_folder = os.path.join(root_folder, x)
        if os.path.isdir(data_folder):
            data_file = os.path.join(data_folder, x + '.txt')
            if os.path.isfile(data_file):
                data_folders.append(x)
    return sorted(data_folders))
```
This function was designed to search through "training" parent directory (given by root_folder) to list subdirectories folders in the `data_folders` variable. `data_folders` contains the list of folder names (patient numbers) for which a corresponding .txt file exists inside their respective folder. For instance, if in the directory for patient "0284" there is a file named 0284.txt, then "0284" will be added to the data_folders list.
